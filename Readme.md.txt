When I started OSCP, I didn't even know about nmap, so it is not that before attempting OSCP you have to learn something.

Only prerequisite is:
1. Basic understanding of OS, and TCP/IP protocol
2. Also, it would be great if you are familiar with basic commmands in linux and windows.
3. Able to read and understand code written in C, python and bash

Through this guide, I will guide you to the resource that will help you in your OSCP as well as pentesting journey.

I am writing this guide to cover all topics in details as well as cheat-sheet so that you can use the commands directly once you understand the topics/tools.
