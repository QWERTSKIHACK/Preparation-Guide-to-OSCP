### Passive Information Gathering

- Passive information gathering can be done using google or any other search engine.

- It can be any information that is available publicly, eg, you can gather emails of employee from linkedin, any information available on blogs/articles.

- If it is web penetration job, make sure to check their website, check  what kind of products they sell, is there any job vacancy available, if there is a web developer vacancy, check the skills that they are looking, it will most probably contain the technology their website is based upon.

### Google Hacking Database/Google Dork

I think everyone should learn how to use google efficiently.

Google has some very good search operators to find information that is not readily available on a website. These are called google dorks.

Google hacking database contains thousands of these filters which can help an information security person to find misconfiguration.

The basic syntax for advanced operators in Google is:

operator_name:keyword

Make sure there is no space between operator_name and keyword.

Some of the great google dorks which I use are:

site – will return website on following domain

allintitle and intitle – contains title specified phrase on the page

inurl – restricts the results contained in the URLS of the specified phrase

filetype – search for specified filetype formats

What Data Can We Find Using Google Dorks?

Admin login pages
Username and passwords
Vulnerable entities
Sensitive documents
Govt/military data
Email lists
Bank account details and lots more

if you want to list all the website that have exact phrase. search for a string like "access denied for user".
