Information gathering is the most essential phase of pentesting.

More information you gather, more it will be easier for you to penetrate and find the vulnerability.

There are two ways to gather information:

1. Passive Information Gathering
2. Active Information Gathering


Passive Information Gathering is the process of collecting information about your target using publicly available information. This means that you don't interact with your target during this stage of information gathering. So, this is completely legal.

In Active information gathering, you need to interact with the target directly.

It is illegal to do active information gathering, so please make sure you have taken prior written permission from the company/person on whom you want to gather information using Active techniques.
