## Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the process of using automated tools to discover, and identify vulnerabilities in a network.

These are mostly automated tools which can be run against the target.

We can use nmap NSE scipt to fin vulnerability.

All NSE scripts are located in the /usr/share/nmap/scripts folder


kali:~# cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
root@kali:/usr/share/nmap/scripts# ls -l *vuln*

Use NSE script like this:
kali:~# nmap -v -p 80 --script=http-vuln-cve2010-2861 10.1.1.22

Apart from NSE scripts, you can use Nessus and OpenVas for finding the issues.

Be careful when you use vulnerability scanners on your targets because there is a chance that some of the plugins or features can cause an impact to your target such as taking down that service, locking out user accounts, and even crash the system.
